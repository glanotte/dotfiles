Geoff Lanotte's Dot Files
=======================

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it. These are subject to change on a whim.

Thanks!
-------

I have run out of people to thank for this, but here is a non-exhaustive list:

* Ryan Bates - The initial base project, installation and many of the aliases
* Robby Russel - While I don't use oh-my-zsh, I have taken many many things from there
* Gary Bernhardt - Many of my hacks where inspired from his screencasts


Usage
------------

    This leverages [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for managing the configuration files

Prerequisites
-------------

  @tpope's Pathogen: https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
  GNU Stow: https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/

Troubleshooting
---------------

  If the color schemes aren't loading when you start VIM, copy the colors subdirectory from the vim directory in this project to ~/.vim
